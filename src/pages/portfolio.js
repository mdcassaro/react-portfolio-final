            <h1>Horiseon Marketing Website</h1>
            <p>I was responsible for organizing and maintaining the code for Horiseon Marketing Website. The website was made compatible with various sized viewports. I gave the images an alt tags. The semantics were organized so header numbers came in order. All superflourious CSS tag designations were removed. Combined classes A,B, and C in CSS to make a more effecient stylesheet. Unneccessary ID tags were removed. Clearfix was administered to maintain website integrety when viewport is shrunk or on mobile devices.</p>
